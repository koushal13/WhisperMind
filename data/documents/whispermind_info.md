## About WhisperMind

WhisperMind is a privacy-first AI chatbot that runs entirely offline. It combines several powerful technologies:

### Key Features
- **Local Language Models**: Uses Ollama to run LLMs like Llama3 and Mistral locally
- **Document Search**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with ChromaDB for semantic search
- **Voice Interface**: Speech-to-text with Whisper and text-to-speech with system TTS
- **Privacy First**: No data ever leaves your machine

### How It Works
1. Documents are processed and stored in a local vector database
2. When you ask a question, relevant documents are retrieved
3. The local LLM generates an answer using the retrieved context
4. Voice input/output is processed locally using Whisper and system TTS

### Benefits
- Complete privacy and data control
- Works offline without internet
- Customizable and extensible
- Cost-effective (no API fees)
